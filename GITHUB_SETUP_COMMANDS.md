# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `universal-soul-ai`
3. Description: `Universal Soul AI - Privacy-first Android overlay with 360° gesture recognition and voice interface`
4. Make it Public (recommended for open source) or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Run These Commands
After creating the repository, run these commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/universal-soul-ai.git

# Push all code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify GitHub Actions
After pushing:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. You should see a workflow called "Build Android APK" starting automatically
4. Wait for it to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)
5. Check the "Releases" section for the generated APK
