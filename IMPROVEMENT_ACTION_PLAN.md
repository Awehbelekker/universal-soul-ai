pip install --user easyocr pytesseract
# Or use conda for better Windows compatibility
conda install easyocr pytesseract
```

**Timeline:** 1 day  
**Expected Improvement:** +10-15% visual task accuracy

### 6. Voice Interface Enhancement
**Current Status:** 100% accuracy in simulation, needs real API integration

# Integrate real voice APIs
def enhance_voice_interface():
    # Add ElevenLabs API integration
    # Add Deepgram API integration
    # Implement real-time voice processing
    # Add voice command learning
```

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Expected Improvement:** Real-world voice accuracy validation
